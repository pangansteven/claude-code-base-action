## Getting Started

To get started with the Claude Code Base Action, you need to have a GitHub repository where you want to use this action. Follow these steps to set up your workflow:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**: If you don't have one, create a new repository on GitHub.
2. **Add Your API Key**: Go to your repository settings and add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a secret.
3. **Create a Workflow File**: In your repository, create a new YAML file in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Usage

You can use the Claude Code Base Action in your workflow file by specifying the action and providing the necessary inputs. Here are a few examples of how to use it:

### Using a Direct Prompt

```yaml
name: Run Claude Code with Direct Prompt

on: [push]

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Claude Code with direct prompt
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-base-action@beta
        with:
          prompt: "Your prompt here"
          allowed_tools: "Bash(git:*),View,GlobTool,GrepTool,BatchTool"
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Using a Prompt from a File

```yaml
name: Run Claude Code with Prompt File

on: [push]

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Claude Code with prompt file
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-base-action@beta
        with:
          prompt_file: "/path/to/prompt.txt"
          allowed_tools: "Bash(git:*),View,GlobTool,GrepTool,BatchTool"
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

## Examples

Here are some practical examples to illustrate how to use the Claude Code Base Action effectively.

### Example 1: Simple Prompt

In this example, you can run a simple prompt to fetch information about your project.

```yaml
name: Simple Claude Code Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get Project Info
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-base-action@beta
        with:
          prompt: "What are the main features of this project?"
          allowed_tools: "View"
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

### Example 2: Using a Prompt File

You can store complex prompts in a text file and reference them in your workflow.

```yaml
name: File-Based Claude Code Example

on: [push]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Analyze Code
        uses: anthropics/claude-code-base-action@beta
        with:
          prompt_file: "./prompts/analyze_code.txt"
          allowed_tools: "Bash(git:*),GlobTool"
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

## Configuration

### Allowed Tools

The `allowed_tools` input specifies which tools Claude Code can use during execution. You can customize this based on your needs. Here are some examples:

- `Bash(git:*)`: Allows any git command.
- `View`: Lets Claude Code view files and outputs.
- `GlobTool`: Enables pattern matching for file names.
- `GrepTool`: Allows searching through text.

### API Key Management

Always store your API keys securely. Use GitHub Secrets to manage your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. This ensures that your key remains private and secure.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the Claude Code Base Action, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly in your repository secrets.
2. **Validate YAML Syntax**: Ensure your workflow YAML file is correctly formatted.
3. **Review Logs**: Check the logs of your GitHub Actions run for any error messages.
